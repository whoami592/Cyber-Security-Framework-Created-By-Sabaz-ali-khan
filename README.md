Explanation

Port Scanner: Uses sockets to check if ports are open on a target IP or hostname. It employs threading for faster scanning, a common technique in network reconnaissance.
Password Hasher: Demonstrates basic SHA-256 hashing, often used to understand how passwords are stored securely.
Results Saving: Saves scan results to a file for later review, mimicking how tools log findings.
Educational Focus: The code is minimal and avoids advanced or dangerous features to stay within ethical boundaries.
Usage

Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
Enter a target IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1 for localhost), a port range (e.g., 1-100), and a password to hash.
The script will scan ports, hash the password, and save results to scan_results.txt.
